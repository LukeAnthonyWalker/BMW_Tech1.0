<p>The mid-sized super-saloon is powered by a twin-turbocharged, straight-six engine driving the rear wheels through a six-speed manual or optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox.
<br>
Standard equipment includes dual-zone climate control, cruise control, adaptive suspension, an 8.8in media and navigation system, parking sensors, DAB radio and heated seats.
<br>
The M3 is one of the most hardcore high-performance saloons on the market, but some drivers find it too aggressive. That’s not a charge you can level at the C63; a fast saloon that’s easier to drive than the M3 and more relaxed.</p>

Well, quite. It is a bit of a departure – a result of the introduction of the 4 Series name to BMW’s mid-sized executive coupé, upon which the M4 is based. The M4 is also available as a convertible, depending on your preference.

The important thing is that – on paper, at least – the M4 seems to be a sort of successor to the legendary M3 coupé of yesteryear.

Power goes to the rear wheels alone, but the previous model’s V8 engine has been replaced with a more powerful and more efficient 425bhp, twin-turbo, 3.0-litre, six-cylinder engine. A six-speed manual gearbox is standard, but the vast majority of UK buyers will opt for BMW’s optional seven-speed dual-clutch ‘M DCT’ auto.

There is, of course, an array of technical trickery as standard, including adaptive dampers, heavily revised aluminium suspension, and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential.
